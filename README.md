# Building React with Broccoli

This repository contains an example of building a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) app with the excellent [Broccoli library](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli). To get started:

1. Clone the repsitory.
2. Install the Broccoli CLI (`npm install -g broccoli-cli`).
3. Install local dependencies (`npm install`).
4. Run the Broccoli development server (`broccoli serve`).
